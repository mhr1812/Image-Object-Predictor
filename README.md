# Image-Object-Predictor
An end-to-end project which combines web development and deep learning to predict the object in the image.
* This project basically allows the user to upload an image and then predicts the object present in the image by returing the prediction accuracy of the top 3 classes which are matched with the object in the image.
* Django web framework is used.
* Keras is used for prediction which uses Tensorflow in the backend.
